# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of Analysis

There are two goals in this analysis. The first of which is to determine the number of Pewlett-Hackard employees that are eligible for retirement by title. The second purpose is to determine the employees eligible for a possible mentorship program.	Using the csv files provided by Pewlett-Hackard, a database was created to reference individual tables for specific data, combine multiple tables based on specific criteria, and create new tables with the new information.

### Retirement Eligibility based on Title

Combining data from the “Employees” file and data from the “Titles” file, a table was created with the names, titles, and dates a title was held for each employee eligible to retire. This list was further filtered to remove duplicate data. These duplicates are the result of a single employee holding more than one position, due to promotion, transfer, or other positional change.
